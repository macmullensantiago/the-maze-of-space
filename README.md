## The Maze of Space Goblins

...is a puzzle game made for [js13k 2021 game programming competition](http://js13kgames.com/).

### Building

Assuming that you have `make` and `tsc` installed, just type `make js` to build the game. Then you can start a server in the root to play the game. If you do not have `make`, you can copy-paste the line below `js` in the file `makefile` to the terminal/command prompt and run it.

To minify and compress the code, type `make closure dist` (Closure is included in this repo). It will produce a zip file that should stay below 13kB (at least on my PC!).

### License

Do not steal. Give credit if you end up using the code for some weird reason.
